# Connect-Four
This is a two-player game in which you win by having four connecting circles.
The standard board is 7 x 6. And the standard color for player 1 is red and yellow for player2.
You can choose to change the column and row number, as well as the color for each player.
After the board size and color are confirmed, the program prompts the player to make a move, drop or pop.
You can LEFT click to drop, and RIGHT click to pop.
The program checks whether each move is valid before switching the turn and the updated gameboard is printed after each player makes a move.
The game continues until one of the players has four pieces in a row and wins the game.
